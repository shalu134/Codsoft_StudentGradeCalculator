# Student Grade Calculator – Codsoft Internship Task 2

# Overview

This project is the second task of my Codsoft Java Internship.
It is a console-based student grade calculator built in Java. The program allows the user to input marks for multiple subjects, calculates the total marks, percentage, and assigns a grade according to predefined criteria.

The project focuses on practicing core Java concepts such as:

Using arrays or collections to store subject marks,

Implementing loops and conditional statements for calculations,

Handling user input safely with the Scanner class,

Applying modular programming by dividing tasks into methods.
# Features

Accepts marks for multiple subjects from the user.

Calculates total marks and percentage automatically.

Assigns grades (A, B, C, D, F) based on percentage.

Supports input validation to prevent invalid marks entry.

Option to calculate grades for multiple students in one session.
# Objectives

This task was designed to:

1. Strengthen Java programming fundamentals.


2. Practice working with loops, arrays, and conditional logic.


3. Demonstrate the ability to process and calculate data in a console application.


4. Produce accurate and readable output for the user.
# Tools & Technologies

Programming language: Java (JDK 11 or later recommended)

IDE / Editor: Any Java-compatible IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code) or command-line tools.

Standard Libraries: java.util.Scanner for input handling.
